            <p>So that you can see that this site will give you always extra information that you will never find on another page. We will give you some tips for altitude sickness that you must consider before coming to this beautiful land.</p>
            <p>1. If you come from a city at sea level, it is advisable that you visit your doctor before coming to Quito, he or she will give you some advice about the symptom, and how to prevent altitude sickness.</p>
            <p>2. Have a health insurance</p>
            <p>3. When you come to Quito, you need to stay hydrated by drinking at least 4 or 5 liters of water before traveling, and while traveling.</p>
            <p>4. Upon arrival, take your favorite headache medication, even if you don't have a headache. </p>
            <p>5. Since your stomach is likely to struggle at altitude, at least for the first few days, treat it with respect. Eat lightly and consider eating lots of soup instead of heavy foods. </p>
            <p>6. Postpone Higher Altitude Day Trips. If you or someone in your group is feeling the effects of high altitude, don't go any higher. If necessary, have a backup plan if symptoms start.</p>
