            <h2> Cesar Pacas</h2>
            <h2>Newton</h2>
            <p> Hello, my name is Cesar Pacas but my family and friends called me by my second name Isaac
                because my grand-father and father have the same name (Cesar). Also, my father and some friends 
                called me sometimes Newton because of Isaac Newton . I am from Ecuador and I live 
                in the city of Quito in the middle of the world. I have been member of the church my whole life and  
                I served in the mission Peru Lima Central whcih was one of the best experiences and a great blessing 
                that I could receive of my Saviour. 

                <br><br> Currently, I am studying Eletrical Engineering at National Polytechnic School in my city 
                because I like science, maths, technology as well as languages, and history. I also decided to 
                study at BYUI in  order to improve  some topics like programing, web design, etc. which are useful 
                for my career, and after finishing my degree 
                in electricity, I want to focus on obtaining the bachelor degree in Applied Techonology.

                My hobbies are playing the guitar, the piano and I also like sports especially soccer, basketball
                and swimming.   
                <br> <br> Finally, I want to say that The Church of Jesus Christ is directed by the Saviour and that the
                System Education of this Church is inspired by God.
